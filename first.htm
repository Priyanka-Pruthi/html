<p>Looking back, as a son of a guide traveling around New York and Canada in the late 50”s and early 60”s, with my father and his groups seeing all the wondrous sights; I grew up with a canoe paddle in my hand and a backpack on my back.

As we all do, I drifted away from the outdoors, for girls, cars and a family. Then came the words from my son,” Would you go camping with my Boy Scout troop?”

And so it began, one night a week, one weekend a month, teaching our youth cooking, camping, outdoor skills and going on canoe trips again. I met all kinds of great kids and adults who wanted to learn about the great outdoors, but didn’t know where to get first hand knowledge.

I longed for more challenges and more knowledge. Then I heard about man who, in a downpour, portaging a canoe in the Adirondacks, was singing his heart out. A man I had to meet. So entered my partner, a man with a passion for the outdoors bigger than the outdoors itself. We paddled and hoofed our way through New York, Pennsylvania and Canada. With a very early retirement the question was posed “are you going to be a detriment to society or do you want to do something with our knowledge?” And so Paths Peaks & Paddles was born.</p>
